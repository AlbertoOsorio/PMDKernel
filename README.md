This respository cointains the code to a custom CUDA Julia kernel. It is optimized for calculating the magnetic field of large sets of permanent magnets, modeled as dipole moment vectors, in any point in space.

As an application, the file B0.jl provides a full simulation of the magnetic field $B_0$ of the Open Source Imaging Initiative's (OSI²) OpenMRI.
